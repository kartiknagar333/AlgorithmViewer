# AlgorithmViewer

## Overview

**AlgorithmViewer** is an iOS application designed to visualize various sorting algorithms. Users can watch how sorting algorithms like **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Insertion Sort** work, with a step-by-step animation to enhance learning and understanding.

## Features

### Key Features:
- **Algorithm Visualizer**: Allows users to visualize sorting algorithms in real-time.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Includes popular sorting algorithms like:
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
- **Interactive Interface**: Control the speed of the animation and the dataset size.
- **Randomized Data**: Generate random datasets to see how the algorithms perform on different inputs.
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Observe each step of the sorting process.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift** for iOS development.
- **Xcode** for project development and building.
- **UIKit** for the graphical user interface.
- **GCD (Grand Central Dispatch)** for step-by-step execution.
